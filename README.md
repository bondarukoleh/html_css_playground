### Learning the HTML/CSS and Browser JavaScript

It's a bunch of drafty notes and examples that I would like to try and understand. \
I'm having this repo to gather my knowledge about HTML/CSS. \
Information is spread between .md files and .html pages that I've tried to make understandable, a lot of work needs to
be done more of course. Information is not that organized as I wish it to be, but maybe with time I'll make a nice
resource.

A few topics to take a look at:
* `HTML4` featured pages can be found [here](htlm4_sandbox/pages/index.html)
* `HTML5` featured pages can be found [here](html5_css3_sandbox/pages/home_page.html)
* A nice `HTML5/CSS3/SASS` course with a bunch of information [here](modern_html_css_course/info/basics.md)
* Everything about the browser JS [here](browser_javaScript/info/document.md)
