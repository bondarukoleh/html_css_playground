W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).
####Basic Markup
The basic idea behind HTML — you use `elements` to structure your content.
`In 1998, the W3C stopped working on HTML` and attempted to improve it with an XML-powered successor called XHTML 1.0.
It's the strict version of html, where developers of XHTML tried to reduce errors that web-devs can make in a html.
But neither of browsers is supporting this standard, so you still could run dirty html and call it xhtml.
XHTML should fix this problem, but it was developed too slowly and brings breaking changes along, so it slowly leaked 
away.
`Since 2004 html is back to life.`
A group of individuals from Opera Software and the Mozilla Foundation tried to get XHTML to introduce more
developer-oriented features. When they failed, `Opera, Mozilla, and Apple formed the WHATWG` (Web Hypertext Application
Technology Working Group) to extend html with backward-compatible way.
The earliest version of its work had two addon specifications called Web Applications 1.0 and Web Forms 2.0.
Eventually, these standards evolved into HTML5.
By 2007, the WHATWG camp had a lot of developers. The W3C decided to disband the group that was working on XHTML 2 and
work on formalizing the HTML5 standard instead.
HTML5 is really a web of interrelated standards. This approach is both good and bad.
It’s good because the browsers can quickly implement mature features while others continue to evolve.
It’s bad because it forces web page writers to worry about browser supports each feature they want to use.
The W3C is in charge of determining what is and isn’t official HTML5.
The WHATWG continues its work dreaming up future HTML features. They call it HTML (not HTML5), explaining that HTML
will continue as a living language. Means, an HTML page will never become obsolete and stop working, or have a version
number, and web developers will never need to “upgrade” their markup from one version to another to get it to work
on new browsers. By the same token, new features may be added to HTML at any time.

#####Three Key Principles of HTML5
1. `Don’t Break the Web` - a standard shouldn’t introduce changes that make other people’s web pages stop working.
